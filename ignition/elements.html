									<p>The Idea Behind this website and chatbot is to help fellow students manage time and have a schedule that can easily be accessed. It can track your tasks and time in order to help you with your tasks. We wanted to provide a scheduling and motivating service to students as many students find it hard to manage time, follow deadlines and thrive in the difficulties. We believe Mitra provides a solution to them. Users can use Mitra to earn better grades, stay up-to-date on tasks, remember events, and learn to manage time. What more? This scheduler is completely free and you do not have to sign up.</p>
                                                                        <p>Our Vision is to help these people to have a better time learning and prioritizing time for School and Personal Work. Our mission was to provide a website that can manage, modify and keep track of the work they need to do. This schedule is very easy to use and the best part is that there is no subscription needed and it is completely free!</p>

									<h3> How it is helpful?</h3>
									<blockquote>The chatbot allows students and learners to talk with it, and helps them organize themself in a systematic way. We have built this for 2 main reasons Reduce Stress and Pressure among students and Talk openly with someone who can listen.</blockquote>
									<h3>Why Mitra?</h3>
									<blockquote> Manging time means to prioritize your work and set due dates. There are various strategies to choose from, and you have to use the option that works for you. An awesome example is the Pomodoro technique. It is a timer that allows you to stay focused and finsih your tasks within blocks of time. Another option is making a schedule, which is the service we provide you. That is because, there are 3 key factors in managing time: Staying Focused/being Productive, Organizing tasks and times and planning for your work. With our schedule builder, you can easily plan your work and modify changes, orgnaize these events and plan your day to finish your work.</blockquote>
