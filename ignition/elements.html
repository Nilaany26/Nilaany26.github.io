									<hr />
									<p>The Idea Behind this website and chatbot is to help fellow students manage time and have a schedule that can easily be accessed. It can track your tasks and time in order to help you with your tasks. We wanted to provide a scheduling and motivating service to students as many students find it hard to manage time, follow deadlines and thrive in the difficulties. We believe Mitra provides a solution to them. Users can use Mitra to earn better grades, stay up-to-date on tasks, remember events, and learn to manage time. What more? This scheduler is completely free and you do not have to sign up.</p>
									<hr />
									<h3> How it is helpful?</h3>

									<h3>How to Manage Time?</h3>
