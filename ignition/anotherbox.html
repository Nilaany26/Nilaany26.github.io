							<p>The Idea Behind this website and chatbot is to help fellow students manage time and have a schedule that can be easily made and accessed. It can track your tasks and time in order to help you with your work. We wanted to provide a service to students as many student find it hard to manage time and follow deadlines. We believe this service provides a solution to them. They can use to earn better grades, stay up-to-date on tasks, remember events, and learn to manage time. What more? This scheduler is completely free and you do not have to sign up.</p>
